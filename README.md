# Probabilistic Graphical Models and HHMMs – Optimal Transport Perspective

This repository contains a LaTeX-based scientific paper exploring **probabilistic graphical models**, with a particular focus on **Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models (HHMMs)** and their connection to **optimal transport theory**.

## Overview

The document introduces a structured probabilistic modeling approach based on hierarchical HMMs, building up from classical HMMs to more sophisticated representations. It places special emphasis on:

- Graphical interpretation and transition dynamics
- Recursive state dependencies and observation structures
- Parametrization of emission and transition probabilities
- Integration with variational and optimal transport formulations

## Highlights

- **Graphical Models Formalism**: Directed graphs are used to express conditional independence and factorization properties in complex models.
- **HHMM Recursion**: Clear presentation of recursive structure using parent/child node indexing.
- **Optimal Transport Connection**: Discussion of how transport distances (like Wasserstein) and entropy regularization relate to inference in probabilistic models.

## Structure

The paper is organized as follows:

1. **Graphical Model Framework** – Introducing probabilistic dependencies through DAGs.
2. **Markov Models & HMMs** – Building the base case for inference and likelihood formulation.
3. **Hierarchical HMMs (HHMMs)** – Extending HMMs to nested temporal structures.
4. **Probability Laws in Trees** – Recursive and parametric view of HHMM transitions.
5. **Application to Variational Inference and OT** – Sketching a link with optimal transport.

## Prerequisites

To understand the paper, you should be familiar with:

- Bayesian networks and conditional independence
- Hidden Markov Models and EM algorithms
- Optimal Transport and Entropy Regularization
